## Overview / Proje Hakkında

This repository contains the metadata, calibration pipeline, Python GIS automation
scripts, and technical documentation for georeferencing the **1930s Dutch Colonial
Topographic Map Series of Bangka Island (KK 083-04-01 / 085-04-10)**.

The pipeline transforms 176 unreferenced historical scanned map sheets into a
**georeferenced spatial dataset (WGS 84 / EPSG:4326)** intended as a ground-truth base
layer for **deep-learning / computer-vision** analysis of historical land use and
long-term deforestation.

The authoritative English methodology write-up is [`METHODOLOGY_REVISED_EN.md`](METHODOLOGY_REVISED_EN.md); the full technical report is [`bangka_technical_report.md`](bangka_technical_report.md).

## Dataset Composition

- **164 single-cell sheets** — one 5′ × 5′ graticule cell each.
- **12 composite sheets** — printed across two adjacent cells (9 vertical 5′ × 10′,
  3 horizontal 10′ × 5′) to capture coastlines where a full cell would be mostly sea.

## Key Results (verified)

1. **Exact single-cell tiling.** Back-computing the grid origin from all 164 single-cell
   outputs gives a scatter of **σ = 0.0000′** in both latitude and longitude — the 164
   sheets tile with no residual gap or overlap.
2. **Consistent pixel scale.** Measured mean **0.00001904 °/px** vs. the nominal
   0.00001920 °/px (5′ ÷ 4341 px) — a **−0.85 %** deviation (σ ≈ 0.007 %), i.e. no
   significant shrinkage.
3. **Systematic offset (theoretical grid → real world).** A single, highly consistent
   shift maps the theoretical Dutch graticule onto the OSM-verified real-world position:
   **+0.14083° (+8.450′) East** and **+0.00012° (+0.007′) North**, σ = 0.0000′. A
   sub-arc-minute term (Batavia → WGS 84 datum + paper drift, order tens of metres) sits
   on top of this base.
4. **Composite anchoring rule.** For every one of the 12 composites, the **first letter
   of the sub-code names the land cell**, and the sheet is anchored to that cell
   (12 / 12). Codes are order-sensitive (`ni` = land in lower cell, `in` = land in upper
   cell). There are **zero cell overlaps**; each composite's companion (sea) cell is
   intentionally empty.

## Data Provenance & Source

The 176 map sheets are digitized scans from the map series
**"Res. Bangka en Onderhoorigheden"** (topografische en fotogrammetrische
kaartering), scale 1:25,000, produced by the **Topografische Dienst in
Nederlandsch-Indië** (Topographic Service of the Netherlands East Indies),
Batavia. Survey/publication: 1930–1936 (e.g. sheet *Blad 31/XXIV q*, surveyed 1932).

### Dataset metadata provenance & contribution
`bangka_dataset.csv` (the original sheet index / metadata table) was **not
compiled by the repository owner**. It was provided as source material by
Thomas Smits (supervisor); the original compiler of the underlying table is not
documented beyond this. The contribution in this repository is the
**correction and maintenance** of that table, producing the updated
`bangka_dataset_v2.csv`. The georeferencing pipeline and the accuracy metrics
reported here are the owner's own work.

## Downloading the Full Map Dataset (GeoTIFFs)

Due to GitHub size limits (100 MB per file; large repos discouraged), the georeferenced
GeoTIFF archives (`GEOREF_FINAL_STANDARD_164/`, `GEOREF_FINAL_COMPOSITE_12/`) and the raw
scans (`main maps/`, `recovered_maps/`) are **not** tracked in this Git repository. The
full ~6 GB dataset is hosted on the Hugging Face Hub:

**📦 https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibrahimatlgn/bangka-1930s-topographic-maps**

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download(
    repo_id="ibrahimatlgn/bangka-1930s-topographic-maps",
    repo_type="dataset",
    local_dir="bangka_data",
    allow_patterns=["GEOREF_FINAL_STANDARD_164/*"],  # or omit to fetch everything
)
```

## Using the Data (Quick Start)

The published outputs are plain **GeoTIFF** rasters in **WGS 84 (EPSG:4326)** — no
special tooling is needed, any GIS reads them directly.

1. **Get the rasters.** Download `GEOREF_FINAL_STANDARD_164/` (the 164 single-cell
   sheets) and, if you need the coastline sheets, `GEOREF_FINAL_COMPOSITE_12/` from the
   external host (see below). The scripts in this repo are only needed if you want to
   *reproduce* the georeferencing — not to *use* the maps.
2. **Open them.** In **QGIS**: `Layer → Add Layer → Add Raster Layer…`, select the
   `.tif` files (you can multi-select the whole folder). They land in their real-world
   position automatically. To start, open a few single-cell sheets from
   `GEOREF_FINAL_STANDARD_164/` — they tile seamlessly (σ = 0.0000′).
3. **Add a basemap for context** (optional): `XYZ Tiles → OpenStreetMap`, so the
   historical sheets overlay on modern geography.
4. **Composites:** each of the 12 composite sheets covers a land cell plus an
   (intentionally empty) sea cell; place them the same way — they will not overlap the
   single-cell sheets.
5. **Command-line check** (optional): to confirm a downloaded folder is correctly
   georeferenced, run `python verify_georef.py`, which prints the corner coordinates of
   the first few sheets. Inspect any single file with `gdalinfo <sheet>.tif`.

## Requirements & Installation

Only needed to **reproduce** the pipeline (not to view the data).

**Recommended — conda** (installing GDAL via pip is unreliable):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bangka-gis
```

(pip alternative: `pip install numpy pandas gdal opencv-python Pillow` — but the
GDAL wheel often fails to build; conda-forge is strongly preferred.)

```bash
# Expected input layout: raw scans in 'main maps/', crops in 'recovered_maps/',
# original metadata table in 'archive/bangka_dataset.csv'.
# Reproduce the pipeline (run from the repository root, in order):
python map_crop.py          # 1. crop raw scans      → recovered_maps/
python recalc_margins.py    # 2. recompute margins   → bangka_dataset_v2.csv
python automated_georef.py  # 3. grid + offset georef → GEOREF_FINAL_STANDARD_164/
python crop_margin_geo.py   # 4. margin correction against the reference
```

## Known Limitations

- The "seamless" claim is quantified for the 164 single-cell sheets (σ = 0.0000′). A
  per-sheet accuracy figure for the 12 composites (e.g. OSM overlay or neatline residual)
  is a recommended next step; automated neatline detection was attempted but the printed
  frame lines on these scans proved too faint for reliable measurement.
